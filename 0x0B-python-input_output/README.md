# 0x0B Python - Input/Output :snake:

> Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's often used as a “scripting language” for web applications. This means that it can automate specific series of tasks, making it more efficient. This project covers input and output for manipulation of external files

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:
  
* How to open a file
* How to write text in a file
* How to read the full content of a file
* How to read a file line by line
* How to move the cursor in a file
* How to make sure a file is closed after using it
* What is and how to use the with statement
* What is JSON
* What is serialization
* What is deserialization
* How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string
* How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout
1. Function that returns the number of lines of a text file
2. Function that reads n lines of a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout
3. Function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written
4. Function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added
5. Function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string)
6. Function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string
7. Function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation
8. Function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”
9. Script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file
10. Function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object
11. Class Student that defines a student
12. Class Student that defines a student by: (based on 11-student.py)
13. Class Student that defines a student by: (based on 12-student.py)
14. Function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n
15. Function that inserts a line of text to a file, after each line containing a specific string 
16. Script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics (Task in progress)
17. Script that finds a string in the heap of a running process, and replaces it (Pending task)
