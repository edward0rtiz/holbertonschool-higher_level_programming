# 0x08  Python - More Classes and Objects :snake:

> Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's often used as a “scripting language” for web applications. This means that it can automate specific series of tasks, making it more efficient. This project covers classes and objects with more complex development using OOP

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:
  
* What is OOP
* “first-class everything”
* What is a class
* What is an object and an instance
* What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
* What is an attribute
* What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
* What is self
* What is a method
* What is the special __init__ method and how to use it
* What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
* What is a property
* What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
* What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
* What are the special __str__ and __repr__ methods and how to use them
* What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__
* What is a class attribute
* What is the difference between a object attribute and a class attribute
* What is a class method
* What is a static method
* How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
* How to bind attributes to object and classes
* What is and what does contain __dict__ of a class and of an instance of a class
* How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
* How to use the getattr function
