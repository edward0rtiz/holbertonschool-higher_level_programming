# 0x14 Javascript - Web scraping :roller_coaster:

> JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. This project covers scrapping using JS dinamically

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:
  
* How to manipulate JSON data
* How to use request and fetch API
* How to read and write a file using fs module

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Script that reads and prints the content of a file. 
1. Script that writes a string to a file.
2. Script that display the status code of a GET request.
3. Script that prints the title of a Star Wars movie where the episode number matches a given integer
4. Script that prints the number of movies where the character “Wedge Antilles” is present.
5. Script that gets the contents of a webpage and stores it in a file.
6. Script that computes the number of tasks completed by user id.
7. Script that prints all characters of a Star Wars movie
8. Script that prints all characters of a Star Wars movie (Pending task)
9. Script that takes in 3 strings and sends a search request to the Twitter API (Pending task)
