# 0x10  Python - Network #0 :snake:

> Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's often used as a “scripting language” for web applications. This means that it can automate specific series of tasks, making it more efficient. This project covers network implementations using Python nd BASH

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:
  
* What a URL is
* What HTTP is
* How to read a URL
* The scheme for a HTTP URL
* What a domain name is
* What a sub-domain is
* How to define a port number in a URL
* What a query string is
* What an HTTP request is
* What an HTTP response is
* What HTTP headers are
* What the HTTP message body is
* What an HTTP request method is
* What an HTTP response status code is
* What an HTTP Cookie is
* How to make a request with cURL
* What happens when you type google.com in your browser (Application level)

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a request to that URL, and displays the size of the body of the response
1. Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a GET request to the URL, and displays the body of the response
2. Bash script that sends a DELETE request to the URL passed as the first argument and displays the body of the response
3. Bash script that takes in a URL and displays all HTTP methods the server will accept.
4. Bash script that takes in a URL as an argument, sends a GET request to the URL, and displays the body of the response
5. Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a POST request to the passed URL, and displays the body of the response
6. Function that finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers.
7. Bash script that sends a request to a URL passed as an argument, and displays only the status code of the response.
8. Bash script that sends a JSON POST request to a URL passed as the first argument, and displays the body of the response.
9. Bash script that makes a request to 0.0.0.0:5000/catch_me that causes the server to respond with a message containing You got me!, in the body of the response.
