# 0x02 Python - import & modules :snake:

> Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's often used as a “scripting language” for web applications. This means that it can automate specific series of tasks, making it more efficient. This project covers topics of importing modules using python

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:
  
* How to import functions from another file
* How to use imported functions
* How to create a module
* How to use the built-in function dir()
* How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
* How to use command line arguments with your Python programs

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py
1. Program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py
2. Program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.
3. Program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments
4. Program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc
5. Program that imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value.
6. Program that imports all functions from the file calculator_1.py and handles basic operations.
7. Program that prints #pythoniscool, followed by a new line, in the standard output.
8. Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b):
9. Write a program that prints the alphabet in uppercase,
